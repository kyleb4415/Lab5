Ran into some issues connecting to the API. Had to create a 'meaningful user-agent header' to connect to the database. After some searching online,
I was able to create one.

Was able to successfully create classes mirroring artists and events. Was able to deserialize into objects, but noticed that the json string contained multiple 
different artists. Was unable to create a list of artists from the multiple json objects, will try later.

Was able to create lists of artists and events from the json. Unfortunately, I realized that the api doesn't have search functionality for genres yet, so I won't be able to implement them exactly as my plan prescribed.
